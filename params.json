{"name":"5D scene reconstruction from crowdsourcing cameras.","tagline":"master thesis project","body":"### Problem overview.\r\nThe system is developed for the purpose of master thesis project. The main focus of the solution is detection of temporal changes in large-scale scenes reconstructed with use of Structure from Motion(SfM) techniques. Given the SfM reconstruction and new images of the scene, system automatically determines position of new cameras and applies image-based change detection algorithms to produce change mask. Change mask is then projected into 3D space using available from SfM process cameras parameters in order to indicate areas in the scene that might change.\r\n\r\n### Current status\r\nThe project is not yet finished therefore the code available in repository is still a \"work in progress\".\r\n\r\n### Main system components\r\nSystem is based on three main classes. Inheritance diagrams are shown below.\r\n![ChangeDetector class](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lllbausyu8yb891/chD.png)\r\n![ChangeDetectorIO class](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k2b0gea0j0zayb0/chIO.png)\r\n![DataProcessing class](https://www.dropbox.com/s/za09e4zr3pgo5my/data.png)\r\n### Dependencies\r\nThe code is written solely in C++ however it leverages several external libraries and software. In order to run the code one has to make sure first to have installed following components:\r\n* PCL libraries\r\n* VCG libraries\r\n* OpenCV\r\n* boost libraries\r\n* VisualSFM(command line functionality is required - only CUDA enabled hardware)\r\n\r\n### Get the code\r\nIn order to get the code you can either use the links above or run in the terminal\r\n```\r\ngit checkout https://github.com/bheliom/finalProject.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nWaldemar Franczak(@bheliom).\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nPlease write to bhelioom@gmail.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
