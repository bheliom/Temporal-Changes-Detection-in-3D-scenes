{"name":"5D scene reconstruction from crowdsourcing cameras.","tagline":"final project","body":"### Project overview.\r\nProject is developed in frame of master thesis project. The main focus of the project is detection of temporal changes in large-scale scenes reconstructed with use of Structure from Motion techniques.\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nThe code is written solely in C++ however it leverages several external libraries and software. In order to run the code one has to make sure first to have installed following components:\r\n-PCL libraries\r\n-VCG libraries\r\n-OpenCV\r\n-boost \r\n-VisualSFM(command line functionality is required - only CUDA enabled hardware)\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIn order to get the code you can either use the links above or run in the terminal\r\n```\r\ngit checkout https://github.com/bheliom/finalProject.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nWaldemar Franczak(@bheliom).\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nFor any questions please write to bhelioom@gmail.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
